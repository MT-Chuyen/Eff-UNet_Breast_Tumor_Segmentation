# Unet_EfficientNet_Breast_Tumor_Segmentation

Description: A project coded from scratch implements a model with the backbone of EfficientNet B7 as a feature extractor and UNet as a network decoder, the goal is to in turn eliminate skip connections to evaluate dependencies on a specific dataset.

Achievement: The segmentation results are positive with the modified model
