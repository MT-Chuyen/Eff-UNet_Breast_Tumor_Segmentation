/media/mountHDD2/chuyenmt/.env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchvision/models/_utils.py:223: UserWarning: Arguments other than a weight enum or `None` for 'weights' are deprecated since 0.13 and may be removed in the future. The current behavior is equivalent to passing `weights=EfficientNet_B7_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1`. You can also use `weights=EfficientNet_B7_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.
